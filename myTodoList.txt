- Restructure the navbar and the pages so should be separated the Connect page instead of the About.
- In the Connect section include some map, phone number and optionally an email sending opportunity - or at least an email address.
- All the products' 'ask for the price' section should be a button which redirect to the Connect page to get some exact information about the prices.
- On the Products page the filter should have dynamic filter options so it should be impossible to list no products.

+ Redesign the whole site to be prettier and more userfriendly:
- Add some cool jumbotron.
- Add some effects, animations.

- Make the possibility to change between English and Hungarian.

++ Make the possibility to change between light and dark mode.
